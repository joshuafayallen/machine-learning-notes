# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a structured notebook for technical interviews. Grokking the math is can be somewhat time consuming for me and is somewhat akin to writing things down in a third language I have a rough reading proficiency so its not as helpful for me (for now). Instead I decided to collect various notes from classes, empirical work, and studying for comps into one place. In addition to this I kind of also needed to get better with using scikit-learn and tidymodels. If anybody actually ends up finding this whether they be a hiring manager or somebody else figuring studying for technical interview then I say to you welcome! There are more than likely a ton of typos. Right now I am just prepping for job stuff and would not normally expose the world to my brain like this. I just had to publish this online because it was easier to search as a quarto book rather than as a long rambly pdf.
