More importantly we get more coherent measures of uncertainty and are closer to how we actually think of the world. There are lots of broad applications for Bayesianism in the private industry. The betting market for sports and how we think about teams is effectively Bayesian. We incorporate a lot of information about the observable parts of a team like schedule, roster talent, coaching, and guesses about the probablity that the roster will stay healthy. These are all priors we have about things that relate to the success of the team going into the season. As the season progresses and we get data our prior will update. In the case of the Saints this year our prior updated to make them a good team after one game moving our guess about the number of games they would win this year to probably more than their projected win total. With the second win this may have not moved our prior much at all. However, as attrition set in then our prior shifted a little bit back toward the pre-season total so on and so forth.\n\n## What is Baye's Rule? \n\nFormally Bayes rule is usually denoted by this equation.  \n\n$$\nP(A|B) = \\frac{P(A) P(B|A)}{P(B)}\n$$\n\nWhile uber important in respect to Bayesian statistics this not always been the easiest way for me to think of Bayes rules with respect to logic of how we do Bayesian statistics. I think its hard to ground it for me because we can just rewrite it a bit and get the law of total probability which doesn't make it inherently Bayesian. For me I think it is easier to clarify it as \n\n$$\nPosterior = \\frac{Prior \\times \\text{Probability of Hypothesis being true | Data}}{\\text{Mean probability of Data}}\n$$\n\nOr we are just counting the number of instances that we observed this data and then we average over the prior which get us our average. Practically this is really just so everything adds to 1. To be a Bayesian is to incorporate our beliefs and then update them as the data meets our hypothesis meets the data or as Rich McCelreth argues \n\n   > The rules of probability tell us that the logical way to compute the plausibilities, after\naccounting for the data, is to use Bayes’ theorem.\n\nWe then sample from the posterior to communicate something interesting or important about our model. Like where is the mass of the probability distribution, where is the center of this distribution, etc\n\n\nBayesianism, in a way, is a formalization of this process by encoding our beliefs in probability distributions. Our prior is really just our belief about the distribution and plausible range of values for that variable before ever seeing the data. So if we were to set a prior for a coin we would set the prior as somthing kind of loosy goosy as this \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprior_heads = rbinom(n = 2, size = 1000, prob = 0.5)\n\nprior_heads[1]/sum(c(prior_heads[1], prior_heads[2]))\n```\n:::\n\n\nSo in this case we are just stating that the probability of heads is about 50 percent over a thousand trials assuming a fair coin. However, lets say that we know the coin is biased in a known way that makes it come up heads 61% of the time. We could then set our prior that it willl come up heads as this \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprior_heads_biased = rbinom(n = 2, size = 1000, prob = .61)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis is not neccessarily all that unique from a standard null hypothesis which we covered in the opening \"chapter\" of this book. It is the combination of the prior and the posterior which makes the Bayesian machine go brrr. \n\nThe posterior can we operationalized along these lines \n\n$$\nPosterior = \\frac{\\text{Probability of Data} \\times Prior}{\\text{Mean probability of Data}}\n$$\n\nWhere we are averaging the probability of the prior. If we derive this out more formally we will see that the posterior is actually proportional to the prodct of the prior and the probability of the data. The posterior distribution contains the relative plausibility of different parameter values, conditional on the data and model.\nWe can overcome a bad prior given an infinite amount of data, but this process will be inefficient and critically we will never reach infinite data. Priors in Bayesian inference are important computationally as well as substantively. \n\n### What is a prior really? \n\nSetting a prior is one of the hardest things in Bayesian statistics and the subject a large and rich part of the literature. I think one really important thing to adjudicate is what a prior really is. That way we can reinforce the importance of setting a good one, what to check, and how to check it. \n\nAccording to @gelman2013bayesian we can conceptualize the prior distribution along two different lines. There is the *population* interpretation. This is a little frequentisty but is definitely helpful. Lets say that we have some pseudo population of parameters that the candidate parameter $\\beta$ is drawn from. For simplicity sake lets draw $\\beta$ from as standard normal where we overlay the overall distribution \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\nsim_data = \\(beta_val = 0, beta_variance = 1, n = 100){\n  \n  sim_dat = tibble(beta_values = rnorm(n, mean = beta_val, sd = beta_variance),\n                   beta_mean = rep(beta_val, length.out = n),\n                   beta_variance = rep(beta_variance, length.out = n))\n\n  return(sim_dat)\n    \n}\n\npop_sims = map_dfr(c(5, 10, 15), \\(x) sim_data(beta_val = x)) \n\nwide_version = pop_sims |> \n    mutate(id = row_number()) |>\n    pivot_wider(names_from = beta_mean, values_from = beta_values, names_glue = 'mean_{beta_mean}') \n\nplot_dat = wide_version |>\n    mutate(pop_total = pop_sims$beta_values) |>\n    pivot_longer(cols = mean_5:mean_15) |>\n    mutate(nice_labs = as.factor(str_to_title(str_replace(name, '_', \" \"))), \n           nice_labs  = fct_relevel(nice_labs, 'Mean 5', 'Mean 10', 'Mean 15'))\n\n\nggplot(plot_dat) +\ngeom_density(mapping = aes(x = value, y = after_stat(ncount),   fill = nice_labs), \n             stat = \"bin\",  size = 0.5,\n             alpha = 0.7) + \ngeom_density(mapping = aes(x = pop_total, y = after_stat(ncount)), \n                 alpha = 0.9,\n                 color = \"gray30\", size = 0.6, \n             stat = \"bin\",\n             direction = \"mid\") +\n   facet_wrap(vars(nice_labs)) +\n   MetBrewer::scale_fill_met_d(name = 'Lakota') +\n   theme_minimal() +\n   labs(fill = NULL, y = 'Scaled Count') +\n   theme(legend.position = 'none')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Bayesian-Stats_files/figure-html/check2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo in the population interpretation of priors we have kind of weird population by design. Depending on what 'draw' we get our prior could be *N(5,1)* or it could be *N(10,1)* where plausible values center around 5 or 10 with a standard deviation of 1. In this setting we are thinking about given the data what is a reasonable set of values that we would expect to see. In this setting we are kind of explicitly using a bit of frequentist logic to bridge the gap. However, instead of assuming that all values between 5-15 are equally plausible we are expliciltly stating that the mass of the distribution will be around some value and the amount of variation that we will have. This could be useful if we have a huge amount of experiments or results banked and we can imagine our plausible beta values as drawn from some distribution of the experiments.\n\nIn the *state of knowledge* interpretation of priors we are still using our subject matter expertise of the phenomena, but there may not be a good population to ground our priors on. Say we are launching a completly new product or expanding our product into a new market. We may have some idea about what we are likely to see but we don't have the same reference population that we can draw from, but we have at least some idea of what our expectation should be. \n\nAn important thing to note about Bayes Rule is that we can think of Bayes rules along these lines \n\n$$\nPosterior = \\frac{\\overbrace{P(A)}^{\\text{Prior}} \\times \\overbrace{\\text{Probability of Data}}^{Likelihood}}{\\text{Average Probability of Data}}\n$$\n\nWhat this means is that effectively the posterior is a bit of a compromise between our data and our beliefs as the size of the data get bigger our prior will have less of an influence on our posterior distribution, but it will never completely evaporate. \n\n### How to set priors\n\nMost of the time people say just use your substantive knowledge. But that's generally not helpful if you haven't done that in a statistical setting. Lets take it step by step. First we generally outline what we link the distribution of our dependent variable would be. For our outcome variable we may think that its a normal distribution so we would write it like this\n\n$$\nOutcome \\sim Normal(\\mu, \\sigma)\n$$\n\n\nIf it is a binary outcome we would write it like this \n\n\n$$\nOutcome \\sim Bernouli(\\text{Number of Trials},\\text{Probability true})\n$$\n\nThe next step is is we have to think about our generative model. So to ground our analysis it helps to start from a DAG. We generally have beliefs about an intervention in the world. That way we can start thinking about the potential relationships in our data. We then have to think of the plausible ranges for these values and what the uncertainty around them. \n\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\textbf{Outcome} \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma) \\\\[8pt]\n\\textbf{Predictor One} \\sim N (3, 1)\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nWhere we are shifting the mean a bit and putting a somewhat conservative prior. This is generally fine but there are lots of priors we can set. \n\nLets say that out in the real world by some miracle of god we have a true normal distribution where the mean is zero and the standard deviation is 1. We can set informative, weakly informative, flat/non-informative prior, and a conjugate prior. Conjugate priors are a little bit harder to visualize with the below schema because a conjugate prior is something that also relies on the posterior. Meaning that if it turns out the posterior of our mean comes from the same family then it turns out that our prior is conjugate.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn = 1000\n\nprior_df = tibble(\n    pop = rnorm(n),\n    `Kinda Flat` = rnorm(n, sd = 5), \n    informative = rnorm(n, mean = 0.5, sd = 1)\n) |>\n    pivot_longer(everything(),\n        names_to = 'prior',\n        values_to = 'value'\n    )\n\n\nggplot(prior_df, aes(x = value, fill = prior)) +\n    geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c('Kinda Flat' = '#a40000', 'informative' = '#00b7a7', 'pop' = '#ffcd12')) +\n    theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Bayesian-Stats_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis could be better but you kind of get the idea. A flat/uninformative prior is at best a bit like saying \"the parameter of interest is somewhere between $-\\infty$ and $\\infty$.\" My flat prior in the plot is more akin to a weakly informative prior where we are ruling out impossible values, but not really ruling out extreme values. A weakly informative prior is more akin to like we wouldn't expect the treatment effect to be all that big but it is not outside of the realm of possibility that due to a weird draw of the experimental population people really take to the treatment. Priors can get pretty crazy because well the real world is messy and making simplyfying assumptions is hard. This is why (most) Bayesians will simulate the world first before even touching the data. \n\n\n\n\n\n## Simulating Worlds \n\nSimulations are superpowerful because we get to play god in a way that we don't normally get to do as social scientists. We can really simply simulate that you have roughly a 50/50 chance of getting heads or tails. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncoin_flips = replicate(10000, sample(c('heads', 'tails'), 1))\n\ncoin_flips |>\n    as_tibble() |>\n    group_by(value) |>\n    summarise(counts = n()) |>\n    ungroup() |>\n    mutate(probs = counts/sum(counts))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWhile this is intuitive we can see how this varies by number of flips. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnum_flips = 100\n\nflips = sample(c('heads', 'tails'), size = num_flips, replace = TRUE)\n\ncoin_flips = tibble(\n    heads_frequency = cumsum(flips == 'heads')/1:num_flips,\n    flip_number = 1:num_flips\n\n)\n\n\nggplot(coin_flips, aes(x = flip_number, y = heads_frequency)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5) +\n    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,1)) +\n    labs(x = 'Flip Number', y = 'Proportion of Heads') +\n    theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Bayesian-Stats_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn expectation we start getting closer and closer to 50% heads. Neat, but why should we care? Well we can test how well our prior does on various situations with a known truth. \n\nLets take a randomized control trial with unobserved confounding using the really excellent `DeclareDesign` package. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noptions(scipen = 999)\nlibrary(DeclareDesign)\n\nrct <-\n  declare_model(N = 100,\n                U = rnorm(N),\n                potential_outcomes(Y ~ 0.2 * Z + U)) +\n  declare_inquiry(ATE = mean(Y_Z_1 - Y_Z_0)) +\n  declare_assignment(Z = complete_ra(N, prob = 0.5)) +\n  declare_measurement(Y = reveal_outcomes(Y ~ Z)) +\n  declare_estimator(Y ~ Z, inquiry = \"ATE\")\n\n\nfake_data = draw_data(rct)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nSo now we have some fake data where we can display the 'truth' or in this case 0.2 \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndiagnose_design(rct)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWhen we go and estimate it on some fake data we can see how keeping or omitting the unobserved confounding. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncontrol_for_confounding = lm(Y ~ Z + U, data = fake_data)\n\nno_controls = lm(Y ~ Z, data = fake_data)\n\n\nmodelsummary::modelsummary(list('Controls Added' = control_for_confounding,\n                                 'No Controls' = no_controls),\n                          gof_map = 'nobs',\n                          stars = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThis is pretty cool to see how this can go if we don't account for things that should be accounted for. The same general principle applies in Bayesian analysis. The reason we simulate out a RCT is that they are super expensive! We want to diagnose what could go wrong before we tell our partners what to do. The same idea applies for Bayes because we have two separate problems that can make it hard to tell what is going on. We have computational problems that can arise due to how Bayesian models are fit and we have modeling problems which are really just scientific problems. Conceptually these are somewhat distinct but practically these two run into each other all the time. We can isolate some of the computational mechanics of fitting a bad model on data we know is 'good'. This makes fitting lots of models easier. \n\n\nHow should we simulat the data? Typically we will define a parameter that seems reasonable! So if we are trying measure. So if we were trying to model the impact of a treatment on conversion rate aka how often do we move from a free user to a subscriber setting simulating a uniform distribution across treatment and control.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(brms)\nlibrary(modelsummary)\nlibrary(tidybayes)\nlibrary(broom.mixed)\n\nconversions_tibble = tibble(\n    Control = runif(100, min = 0, max = 100),\n    Treatment = runif(100, min = 0, max = 100),\n) |>\n    pivot_longer(everything(),\n    names_to = 'condition',\n    values_to = 'conversion_rate') \n\nggplot(conversions_tibble, aes(x = conversion_rate, fill = condition)) +\n    geom_density() +\n    facet_wrap(vars(condition), ncol = 1) +\n    theme_minimal() + \n    labs(x = 'Conversion Rate', y = NULL) +\n    theme(legend.position = 'none') \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Bayesian-Stats_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe wouldn't expect that by doing nothing that conversion rate is uniformly distributed between 0 and 100 percent.

One way that is fairly common because Gelman reccomends it is prior predictive checks. The first is a prior predictive check which is just a way for us to check on what influence the prior is going to have on the posterior distribution. As our data grows the influence of our prior is going to decrease and the likelihood function is going to start to have more influence on the posterior distribution. Or in other words how probable the observed data is given different value of the model. However, they are not totally irrelevant the prior can impose a form of regularization shrinking the posterior predictions back towards the 'true value.' This is to say that even in large-n settings a well calibrated prior is still important in simple models. In much more complex models the prior is going to do a lot more.\n\nIn a sense we did something similar but what we are doing is modeling the problem only using the priors. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntitanic <- read.csv(\"https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Stat2Data/Titanic.csv\")\ntitanic <- subset(titanic, PClass != \"*\")\n\nf <- Survived ~ SexCode + Age + PClass\n\n\n\nmod_prior <- brm(PClass ~ SexCode + Age,\n    data = titanic,\n     prior = c(\n        prior(normal(0, 3), class = b, dpar = \"mu2nd\"),\n        prior(normal(0, 3), class = b, dpar = \"mu3rd\")),\n    family = categorical(link = logit),\n    sample_prior = \"only\")\n\n\npp_check(mod_prior)   \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Bayesian-Stats_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nIn this case we the prior does okay matching the observed data. It could definitely be better\n\n:::callout\n\nLets break down some `brms` syntax first. \n\n- `prior` - somewhat self explantory\n\n- `normal` - somewhat self explantory\n\n- `class = b` - Set the prior at the population level. \n\n- `dpar = 'class'` - Here we are telling it that we are making an assumption about the probability of being in second or 3rd class relative to 1st class \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmod_prior |>\n    modelsummary()\n```\n:::\n\n\nOne important thing to note is that `brms` is based off of `lme4` which is one of the premier multilevel modeling packages for frequentist. As a political scientist we aren't really multilevel model people we are more throw OLS at everything people so some of the terminology around is different. \n\nIn OLS political science land we would say we include 'class fixed effects' to refer to a model that does something like this. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# this is a bad model don't judge \nlogit_fe = glm(Survived ~ Age + SexCode + factor(PClass), data = titanic, family = binomial(link = 'logit'))\n\nmodelsummary(logit_fe)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhen we say class fixed effects we really just mean including an intercept per classs. In multilevel land what we mean by a fixed effect is really just saying that these effects are constant across groups. So think of the effect of school on classroom performance or the effect of product popularity on ROI on adverstising channels. The way we would replicate the this is something to the effect of \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbrm(Survived ~ Age + (1|PClass), data = titanic) |>\n   modelsummary()\n```\n:::\n\nAdmittedly also a really bad model but you get the idea. \n\n:::\n\nWe can then check our priors. We can also set priors on the intercept in our Titanic example if we stripped away age, class, and sex what would our baseline expectation of survival be? In an RCT this is really just what is a reasonable expectation for our control group. For other more complex models we could put priors on the effect of time, space, interactions between groupings and so much more. \n\n\n\n## Using Brms \n\nAs an R Bayesian we use brm mostly. We are going to walk through a variety of models that you have fit before using frequentist methods using brms. As the excercise progressed it reallly just became redoing the Statistical Rethinking \n\n\n### Linear Models \n\nSo as a good Bayesian we are going to set some priors. First we are going to set a prior for the height in cm and then we are going to set a scale parameter for the weight in kg's and stretches the distribution. The sigma parameter must be positive. The alpha parameter we are going to think about well what if all the covariates were zero? What would a reasonable set of values be? In this case what would be the weight of an individual be if we never took into account height? Well a somewhat reasonable prior is just taking the average of the weight and spreading it out. \n\nStan really likes when you scale things because well it makes everything easier to compute. Rescaling in this case gives us the benefit of making the intercept interpretable. Inside the regression the intercept parameter now just becomes the expected weight of an individual is when they are of average height. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata('Howell1', package = 'rethinking')\n\njust_adults = Howell1 |>\n    filter(age >= 18) |>\n    mutate(height_z = scale(height))\n\n\n\npriors = c(# this is just weight in kilos so approx 132 lbs \n           prior(normal(60, 10), class = Intercept),\n           # this is just centering on the new variable.

In this case `epreds` is going to take the predictions on the probability scale while `linpreds` is going to use the logit scales or the log odds scale(ewww). One of the things about `epreds` is it will shift a lot. For a beta regression the expectation will effectively be the average of the posterior's average. \n\n\n### Working with exponetials and Stratifying by Continous variables\n\nWhen we adjust for a continous variable we are going adjust for the actual values of the continous variables and the slope because every value produces a different relationshiop between the treatment and the ouctcome.

For the most part we some pretty plausible regression lines. We have some weird ones where as the age of marriage increases the divorce rate decreases. Other regression lines we have mostly flat which I guess would make sense since we are not stratifying by state. We can then go ahead and estimate the model. I will spare myself the tedium of specifying two models. Instead we will estimate the effect of age of marriage through marriage rate. I suppose I didn't explain it when I did it earlier because I was getting to angry at getting the `:` syntax to work correctly. \n\nSo the idea is that we really have two models. The effect of Age on Divorce and the effect of Age on marriage. So we have to tell `brms` how do to this because simply doing \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbrm(divorce_z ~ marriage_z + age_z, data = d)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWould just adjust for the age of marriage in our model. This is great if we are only interested in the effect of marriage rate on divorce but is not our stated goal. There are lots of ways to invoke this in brms.

To make sure `brms` doesn't get mad at us we feed just use `resp` to tell it what equation the prior is for. We could obviously change the prior around age of marriage. This could get **super** complicated if we needed it, but for now we are gonna k.i.s.s. \n\nIn the gender example that we worked on earlier we did `set_rescor(TRUE)` which is going to allow correlation betwee the two different equations. This makes sense because we are making the assumption that there are probably other factors that influence this relationship that we don't observe. In our waffle divorce model we would also want to include the effect of region/state.

Instead of simply adding a penalty term to the sum of the squared residuals we can impose some what 'stronger weakly informative priors' or there are priors that are kid of just used for regularization. To pick a model that performs well we should probably have an idea about how to pick a good model. \n\nA good model is one that balances good fit with flexibility to incorporate new data and describes the world realistically.

What we are doing is just throwing a marble into a bowl with n-dimensions and then just recording where it lands. Since it is a bowl the marble is going to end towards the center of the bowl. We are going to use step size to tell our arm how hard to throw the marble. In gradient descent we really just use these throws to give the marble a hint what path would be faster to minimize a loss function.\n\nIn two or three dimensions this is hard when we start adding in the complexities of sampling from a huge dimensional space lots of problems can arise.

Independent chains explore the same or similar region. $\\hat{R}$ is effectively a ratio of variances so we can think of it as \n\n$$\n\\hat{R} = \\frac{\\text{Within Chain Variance}}{\\text{Total Variance of All Chains}}\n$$\n\nIn practice this means that values closer to give us some indication of how well are chains are doing. Values like 1.01 could tell us that we just need to run the chains for longer or that we need to go back and rethink our priors.  \n\n### n_eff or Number of Effective Samples\n\n\nThis is an estimate of the number of effective samples what this is kind of telling us is that \n\n::: {.callout-important}\nHow long would the chain be if each sample was independent of the one before it\n:::\n\nMcElreath argues that we can think of `rnorm` as the ideal behavior of `n_eff` where each draw from a normal distribution is independent of the one before it. So our number of `n_eff` would be equal to what ever you feed the `n` argument. The same idea applies to `n_eff` where we are going to get some number that is generally less than the number of samples we are taking, but sometimes Stan will find places where we can grow the length of the chain. This is not a bug because, well, when we are traversing multidimensional spaces we are not going to be as clever about that as some may think. We would see the number off effective samples shrink if we had autocorrelation because past values of the variables are giving us more information about the variable we are modeling so the length of the chain will be much shorter.

When we made the trace plot we saw that some chains were actually broken so the short length of chains make a ton of sense. When we compare this to a good model the difference is pretty stark \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(wine_score_model)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### The Folk Theorum of Statistical Computing \n\nOften times when we have computational problems with our model we have issues with our scientific problems with our model. Calculating the posterior is hard thats why the racist Sir Ronald Fisher was a coward and took the log of the likelihood. When we are first building a model we will often have problems getting the chains to work well because our assumptions about the world get passsed onto our model. The trouble that we are having sampling from the posterior distribution maybe because it doesn't make any sense.\n\n\n\n\n## Building an Interaction in brms \n\nWe often have conditional hypothesis especially in the social sciences. Political science in particular uses a lot of interaction terms. Some of our most cited statistics articles are interaction terms. Importanly for multilevel models we often times have interactions with lots of factors.

We have really just been using it to constrain the unexplained variance to be postive. The difficulty with setting priors for a logit is that we are doing it on the log odds scale so they don't always have an intuitive mapping as they did in OLS land. \n\nWe can kind of think of it as anything +4 = almost always and anything -4=almost never so when we stretch out the prior or compress it on the logit scale it will create probability distributions we may not have a good intuition of what the prior should be. Fortunately we can get a handle on this using the `qlogis` and `plogis` function from R to get a sense of how our priors are going to translate on the log-odds scale and on the probability scale. The function link function can shrink turn somewhat reasonable priors into really extreme values. This kind of makes since in logit world we our outcome is constrained to 1 and 0 while OLS can take on really any value as long it can be computed. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\ndata(weather_perth, package = 'bayesrules')\n\nweather = weather_perth |>\n    select(day_of_year, raintomorrow, humidity9am, humidity3pm, raintoday) |>\n   mutate(across(c(humidity9am, humidity3pm), \n                ~scale(., scale = FALSE), .names = \"{col}_centered\")) |> \n  mutate(across(c(humidity9am, humidity3pm), \n                ~as.numeric(scale(., scale = FALSE)), .names = \"{col}_c\")) |> \n  mutate(raintomorrow_num = as.numeric(raintomorrow) - 1)\n\nextract_attributes <- function(x) {\n  attributes(x) %>%\n    set_names(janitor::make_clean_names(names(.))) %>%\n    as_tibble() %>%\n    slice(1)\n}\n\nunscaled <- weather %>%\n  select(ends_with(\"_centered\")) |> \n  summarize(across(everything(), ~extract_attributes(.))) |> \n  pivot_longer(everything()) |> \n  unnest(value) |> \n  split(~name)\n```\n:::\n\n\nSo if we think that the baseline rate of rain is about 20% we can get see what a reasonable prior on the log-odds scale would look like this: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqlogis(.2)\n```\n:::\n\n\nSo if we think that there is a range between 15% to 25% of rain is normal than we can translate it to roughly around .5 in either direction.

However, we can use information from each of the runners to learn something about the other runners.

So lets go with the 0.1. Next we are going to think about the relationship between age and time. Or slightly rephrased, as you get older how many minutes do you lose off your mile? That is a somewhat hard question to answer. Lets start with a slightly agressive prior.

A QB can be uber productive in their 30 and above seasons versus a wide receiver or corner. To account for these relationships we need to model a specific intercept and a particular slope for each runner.\n\nWe need a more robust language for these kinds of models because they are uber complicated because now both the intercept and the slope per each runner are going to move together. We could theoretically write them as distributions but the tinkering is going to be a bear. Instead we can use multi-dimensional priors to describe the correlations between the features. There are effectively three things we need to think about \n\n- the feature means: the mean of the intercepts, the global intercept etc\n\n- the correlation matrix: what is the expected correlation \n\n- How much to they vary? \n\nThe tricky part is how do we set a prior for a correlation matrix?

A particularly relevant setup is the mountain climbers example. We often have nested structure so in this case we have climber in expedition teams. For MMM's we have people within channels and within that we have additional structures that we may know based off of demographic information or clusters that we can model. In this case we will start small and then we can build on these fundamentals because we also have expeditions within season and then age. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata('climbers_sub', package = 'bayesrules')\n\nclimbers = climbers_sub |>\n    select(expedition_id, member_id, success, year, season,\n         age, expedition_role, oxygen_used) |> \n  mutate(age_c = scale(age, scale = FALSE))\n\nextract_attributes <- function(x) {\n  attributes(x) %>%\n    set_names(janitor::make_clean_names(names(.))) %>%\n    as_tibble() %>%\n    slice(1)\n}\n\nunscaled_climbers <- climbers %>%\n  select(ends_with(\"_c\")) |> \n  summarize(across(everything(), ~extract_attributes(.))) |> \n  pivot_longer(everything()) |> \n  unnest(value) |> \n  split(~name)\n```\n:::\n\n\nLets get some basic summary statistics \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclimber_expedition = climbers |>\n    group_by(expedition_id) |>\n    summarise(total = n(),\n              prop_success = mean(success))\n\nsuccess_by_size = ggplot(climber_expedition, aes(x = total, y = prop_success)) +\n    geom_count() +\n    labs(x = 'Expedition Team Size', y = 'Proportion of Expedition Team That Finished')\n\ndist_of_team_finished = ggplot(climber_expedition, aes(x = prop_success)) +\n    geom_histogram() +\n    labs(x = 'Proportion of Expedition Team That Finished')\n\nsuccess_by_size + dist_of_team_finished\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Bayesian-Stats_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-107-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNow lets look at the success by size by season \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclimbers |>\n    mutate(total = n(),\n              prop_success = mean(success), .by = expedition_id) |>\n          ggplot( aes(x = total, y = prop_success)) +\n    geom_count() +\n    labs(x = 'Expedition Team Size', y = 'Proportion of Expedition Team That Finished') +\n    facet_wrap(vars(season))      \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Bayesian-Stats_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-108-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is an interesting partial pooling thing that we will look at bit later. Most of the expeditions happen during Spring and Autumn with only a few happening in winter with close to no success and one during summer with close to 100 percent success. So seasons are definitely something that we would want to model. \n\nIf we look at the model in the book we expect that whether or not you use oxygen is importanat \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclimbers |>\n    group_by(age, oxygen_used) |>\n    summarise(success_rate = mean(success)) |>\n    ggplot(aes(x = age, y = success_rate, color = oxygen_used)) +\n    geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Bayesian-Stats_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-109-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs we can see there age is a pretty poor predictor of a success rate compared to oxygen. So now lets set some priors. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclimbing_priors = c(\n    prior(normal(0, 2.5), class = Intercept),\n    prior(normal(0, 2.5), class = b),\n    prior(exponential(1), class = sd)\n)\n\nclimbing_prior_mod = brm(\n    success ~ age_c + oxygen_used + (1 | expedition_id),\n    data = climbers, \n    family = bernoulli(link = 'logit'),\n    prior = climbing_priors,\n    sample_prior = 'only'\n)\n\ncheck_prds = climbers |>\n    add_predicted_draws(climbing_prior_mod, ndraws = 1000)\n\nggplot(check_prds, aes(x = age, y = .prediction, color = oxygen_used)) +\n    geom_dots(aes(side = ifelse(.prediction == '1', 'bottom', 'top')), pch = 19, scale = 0.2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Bayesian-Stats_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-110-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npp_check(climbing_prior_mod)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Bayesian-Stats_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-110-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nHmmm it seems that we could probably do a bit better. If we check the coefficients the implication is that if we use oxygen then it will decrease our likelihood of survival which intuitively we know is crazy! Once again working with \n\n\n\n\n## Ordered Monotonic predictors \n\nLets say we have some ordered predictor like education. We would expect that the difference between elementary and college is not linear. The effect would look something like this \n\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n1(Elementary) \\phi_i = 0 \\\\\n\n2(\\text{Middle School}) \\phi_i = \\delta_1 \\\\\n\n3(\\text{High School})  \\phi_i = \\delta_1 + \\delta_2 \\\\\n\n4 (\\text{Some College}) \\phi_i = \\delta_1 + \\delta_3\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\nAnd so on and so forth. Effectively we are adding the effect current level of education completed plus the effect of the previous level. In our example Elementary school does not really count because it is the first level so the effect of completing elementary school plus the effect of completing middle school is just the effect of middle school. For ordered categories we are sampling from a Dirichlet distribution. Funnily enough these can be thought of as weird beta distributions. \n\n\n## Gaussian Processes \n\nThese seem to be uber popular with Bayesians who do anything related to time and space. The idea kind of boils down to Tobler's first law of geography \"things that are close to each other are more similar than things that are far away from each other.\"  \n\nA Gaussian process is \"an inifinte dimensional generalization of multivariate distributions.\" In English this says that we use a kernel function that generalizes to infinite dimensions/observations/predictions instead of a conventional variance-covariance matrix. If you think of the varying slopes and intercepts models that we have worked with before there isn't any ordering to the categories. I have a hierarcical ranking of seasons but that is not a constraint that I would ever impose on a model. If we wanted to include something like distance or time the variance-covariance matrix would be huge because well it is a continous variable. Instead of the standard matrix we just sub in a kernel to take the place of this big unruly matrix. A kernel function willl generalize to infinite dimensions. The kernel gives the covariance between any pair of points as function of their distance. As always we set a prior which is effectively the rate of decay between the tips. Like 0 distance all the way to the max of the distance and the maximum covariance. These are kind of just regularization priors in some respect. ",
